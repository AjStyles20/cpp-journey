# SumAndMaxProject

## Project Description
A simple C++ program that processes a sequence of digits entered by the user, calculates their sum and maximum value, and prints the results to the terminal.

## Learning Objectives
- [x] Understand basic C++ syntax, some arithmetic operations, conditional statements, loops, arrays and vectors.
- [x] Use `iostream`, `std::cout`, `limits` `vector`, `numeric`, conditional statements like if, else_if and switch and loops like for and while. 
- [x] Compile and execute from the terminal or use the "Run" button in Visual Studio Code. Ensure you have the correct compiler installed (e.g., MinGW for Windows) before setting up C++ in VS Code. See [this beginner-friendly guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw), which explains how to install a compiler, configure VS Code, and run C++ programs specifically with MinGW.

## Technologies Used
- C++ (GNU g++)  
- Visual Studio Code  
  - C/C++ extension by Microsoft  
  - Integrated terminal  

## How to Run
```bash
# Option 1: Name the executable
g++ main.cpp -o SumAndMax
# For Unix-based systems
./SumAndMax
# For Windows users
.\SumAndMax.exe

g++ main.cpp  # This will create an executable named 'a.out' on Unix-based systems or 'a.exe' on Windows by default.
g++ main.cpp

# Note: By default, this will create an executable named 'a.out' on Unix-based systems or 'a.exe' on Windows.
.\a.exe      # For Windows users
