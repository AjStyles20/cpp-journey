# Simple Guessing Game

## Project Description
A fun and interactive C++ program where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## Learning Objectives
- [x] Understand the use of random number generation in C++ using `rand()` and `srand()`.
- [x] Practice using loops (`do-while`) and conditional statements (`if-else`).
- [x] Gain experience with user input and output using `cin` and `cout`.

## Technologies Used
- C++ (GNU g++)
- Visual Studio Code
  - C/C++ extension by Microsoft
  - Integrated terminal

## How to Run
```bash
# Compile the program
# For Unix-based systems
g++ main.cpp -o GuessingGame
./GuessingGame

# For Windows users
g++ main.cpp -o GuessingGame
.\GuessingGame.exe
```

## How to Play
1. Run the program in your terminal.
2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
3. Enter your guesses when prompted.
4. The program will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.

Enjoy the game and test your guessing skills!
