# 03_TemperatureConversion

## Project Description
A simple C++ program that performs basic temperature conversion and prints the results to the terminal.

## Learning Objectives
- [x] Understand basic C++ syntax and arithmetic operations 
- [x] Use `iostream`, `std::cout`, `string` and conditional statements. 
- [x] Compile and execute from the terminal or use the "Run" button in Visual Studio Code (requires setting up C++ in VS Code; see [this beginner-friendly guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw), which explains how to install a compiler, configure VS Code, and run C++ programs).

## Technologies Used
- C++ (GNU g++)  
- Visual Studio Code  
  - C/C++ extension by Microsoft  
  - Integrated terminal  

## How to Run
```bash
# Option 1: Name the executable
g++ main.cpp -o TemperatureConversion
# For Unix-based systems
./TemperatureConversion
# For Windows users
.\TemperatureConversion.exe

.\a.exe      # (For Windows users: use .\a.exe)
g++ main.cpp
./a          # For Unix-based systems
.\a.exe      # For Windows users
