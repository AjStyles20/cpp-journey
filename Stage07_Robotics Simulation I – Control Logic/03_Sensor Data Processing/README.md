# Sensor Data Processing

## Description

This project processes and analyzes sensor data, typically from sources such as temperature, humidity, light, or other environmental sensors. The program reads sensor data from a file or standard input, performs basic processing (such as filtering, averaging, or thresholding), and outputs the results for further analysis or visualization.

---

## Features

- Reads sensor data from a text file or standard input
- Cleans and validates input data
- Calculates statistics (mean, min, max, etc.)
- Applies basic filters (e.g., moving average, thresholding)
- Outputs processed data and summary statistics

---

## How to Run

1. **Compile the code:**
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o sensor_data_processing
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   ./sensor_data_processing data.txt
   ```
   or, to use standard input:
   ```bash
   ./sensor_data_processing
   ```

---

## Input File Format

- Each line contains a single sensor reading (numeric value).
- Example:
  ```
  23.5
  24.1
  22.8
  25.0
  ```

---

## Example Output

```
Number of readings: 4
Minimum value: 22.8
Maximum value: 25.0
Average value: 23.85
Filtered values: 23.5 23.8 23.95 24.4
```

## Learning Objectives

- Reading and validating data from files or input streams
- Performing basic statistical analysis
- Implementing simple data filters
- Outputting results in a clear format

---

## Possible Extensions

- Support for multiple sensor types or columns
- Advanced filtering (e.g., median, Kalman filter)
- Real-time data processing
- Data visualization (e.g., plotting)
