# 05_Capstone Project: Finite State Autonomous Robot with Pathfinding

## Description

This project is a capstone demonstration of an autonomous robot navigating a 2D grid world using a finite state machine (FSM) and A* pathfinding. The robot explores the environment, seeks a randomly placed goal, and manages its battery by recharging at a charging station. The simulation integrates exploration, goal-seeking, resource management, and obstacle avoidance.

## Features

- 2D grid world with random obstacles, goal, and charging station
- Robot with three states: Explore, SeekGoal, Recharge
- Finite State Machine (FSM) for behavior switching
- A* pathfinding for efficient navigation around obstacles
- Battery management: drains on movement, recharges at station
- Console visualization of the robotâ€™s progress and environment
- Robust handling of blocked paths and replanning

## How to Run

1. **Compile the code:**
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o capstone_robot -std=c++11
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   ./capstone_robot
   ```
   or on Windows:
   ```powershell
   .\capstone_robot.exe
   ```
